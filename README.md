# Java8Workshop

This git repository contains exercises for the Java 8 Lambdas/Streams workshop.

## Pre-requisite
In order to try and test this project, you'll need:
- JDK version >= 8
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- IntelliJ (it is my favourite IDE but you can use what you want)

## Project Structure

The overall code layout is:

* Code is in `src/main/java`
* Tests are in `src/test/java`

Within these directories things are organised by package:

* Exercises which involve code in `com.yahyabaassou.java8.exercises`
* Answers are in `com.yahyabaassou.java8.answers`
* Data model used in exercises are in `com.yahyabaassou.java8.model`
* Examples used during the live coding session are in `com.yahyabaassou.java8.examples`

Coding questions are all in the form of failing tests. 
After coding each function you should be able to run unit tests and verify your code.
